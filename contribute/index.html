    <h1>What is this for?</h1>

    <p>As the name suggests, this is going to be a website for CSSOC at Sutton Grammar.</p>

    <p>You have been invited to participate in the development of this website. If you have no piror experience working in a team, that's great! Neither have I. This project is a great opportunity to relearn how to code - trying, failing, and exploring solutions should be the de facto way of learning to code.</p>

    <h2>What do I get?</h2>

    <p>What you put in is what you get out, your experience is entirely up to you. If you have built public facing projects in the past, working in a team will keep everything sounding fresh. Perhaps more importantly, if you haven't built anything with a real purpose before, this project is an opportunity for you to write real code - for the first time.</p>

    <p>Only by writing real code, you will learn to become a developer. This means using the tools everyone uses, and solving problems by instinct. There will be no planning past a quick scribble, and no research past the first forum post. Real development as I experienced it is everything but what the NEA is.</p>

    <h2>What will I learn?</h2>

    <p>There are the <i>developer fundamentals</i> - they will keep your name from being a synonym for pure incompetency.</p>

    <ul>
        <li><a href="https://github.com/apps/desktop" target="_blank">Git</a> and collaboration using <a href="https://github.com/" target="_blank">GitHub</a></li>
        <li>How to effectively copy code from <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/" target="_blank">StackOverflow</a></li>
        <li>An editor such as <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/" target="_blank">VS Code</a> and the tooling offered</li>
        <li>Most importantly... <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/HTML" target="_blank">HTML</a>, <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/CSS" target="_blank">CSS</a>, and <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript" target="_blank">JavaScript</a></li>
    </ul>

    <p>Unlike Java and C++, these are not just any other old languages. They are <i>the</i> languages, real world uses are trivially easy to find. Moreover, getting a hand in web development is the best way to find out how everything works.</p>

    <h2>What should I expect?</h2>

    <p>Web developement is the broadest topic in software engineering, it is almost certain that anything you can ever do is related to some form of web dev. This project - the CSSOC website is an umbrella project consisting of anything web dev related.</p>

    <ul>
        <li><b><a href="./todo.html#art">Art</a></b> - this article is more than a pile of unformatted text, a well formatted layout is the most important to a frontend. From a light sketch of the structure to deciding the colour palette, design is essential to any frontend.</li>
        <li><b><a href="./todo.html#backend">Backend</a></b> - while this site is statically hosted, I am sharing access to my home server for self hosted projects. It is not impossible to create a collection of interconnected backend services featuring user generated content.</li>
        <li><b><a href="./todo.html#content">Content</a></b> - this article is content, there is more to creating content than just writing down everything you know. Besides the typical introductions on what the project is about, we will also be creating wiki/tutorial pages in simple English.</li>
        <li><b><a href="./todo.html#frontend">Frontend</a></b> - the main goal of this website is of course, to communicate information in an aesthetic way. There is much, much more of this site left to be done.</li>
        <li><b><a href="./todo.html#games">Games</a></b> - graphical web apps are fun, from graphing calculators to minigames, they will be some of the most interesting things to run on school computers, the creative <code style="color:#777;transform:translateY(1px);display:inline-block;">&lt;<span style="color:#c2575a;transform:translateY(-1px);display:inline-block;">canvas</span>&gt;</code> is literally here.</li> 
    </ul>
