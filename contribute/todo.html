    <h1>The things left undone</h1>

    <p>Here is a list of subprojects you can pick up. Feel free to add ideas or requests to an existing category, or create a new one. Move the entry you are doing to <a href="./inprogress.html">in progress</a>, edit the entry appropriately if you are only completing part of the subproject.</p>

    <h2 id="art">Art</h2>

    <p>Most art related tasks involves graphical designing of some sort.</p>

    <h3>CSSOC logo design</h3>

    <p>CSSOC is currently lacking a logo, this logo will used as the site favicon, and may be used in other places where CSSOC exists, such as the Discord server.</p>

    <h3>Page designs</h3>

    <p>The website currently has no home page, it would be nice if you can draw it up on Canva or Inkscape or some digital software, a general discription of the idea or style would also be nice.</p>

    <p>Other pages that need designing are</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Published articles page</li>
        <li>MiniInfo home page</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 id="backend">Backend</h2>

    <p>Ask me for SSH access to my Raspberry Pi, you will be able to host anything with the exception of game servers. The Pi runs on Debian 12, with major scripting runtimes and MongoDB installed. If your project requires other dependencites such as Redis or Docker, I can add them as well.</p>

    <h3>Page voting system</h3>

    <p>We will be creating an articles listing, it would be great if we can have a backend service that allows users to up/downvote an article. Some sort of browser fingerprinting should be emloyed to prevent double voting.</p>

    <h3>Gated redirect</h3>

    <p>Sometimes you are sharing a url in a public chat, but wish you should have done it privately. A gated redirect system acts like a link shortener - similar to bitly, except only whitelisted users or users with a passcode will be redirected to the desination page. This is particularly useful for sharing <i>*cough*</i> pirated content in the public.</p>

    <h2 id="content">Content</h2>

    <p>Write something useful.</p>

    <h3>About pages</h3>

    <p>We are missing about pages for the followings.</p>

    <ul>
        <li>CSSOC</li>
        <li>MiniInfo</li>
        <li>CSSOC Overflow (Magazine)</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Wiki/tutorials</h3>

    <p>To explain, and guide readers on how to do things in simple English, we need</p>

    <ul>
        <li>How to contribute to this website (this brings in articles on Git and GitHub)</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 id="frontend">Frontend</h2>

    <p>Feel free to make any modifications to the web pages.</p>

    <h3>Dark theme</h3>

    <p>An auto dark theme for the site can be done by detecting the browser theme, and applying the CSS styles appropriately.</p>

    <h2 id="games">Games</h2>

    <p>Feel free to create any graphical apps under this site, we need an index page for this.</p>

    <h3>Graphical calculator</h3>
    
    <p>Create a Desmos clone with an emphisis on programmability and performance (Desmos is terribly inperformant) - perhaps a pure WASM app would fix the performance issues.</p>

    <h3>FFA chess</h3>

    <p>It would be great to have a .io game where each player spawns in an arena, where each piece will have its move cooldown, perhaps they should be able to move depending on the mode selected. You can gain pieces by levelling up, it will be quite chaotic and fun if a bunch of people are PvPing with chess pieces at the same time.</p>
